# Amulet-Editor-Operations
Authored and Contributed Amulet Editor Operations

* analyze_TWF_v3.py will count the block types in the selection and print the results to the Amulet Editor console, and write the data in JSON format to the file analyze_results.json in your Amulet directory. This Operation is a good example of how to work with the _selection_ to find the co-ordinates of all the selected blocks. It also shows how to work with block metadata in the Amulet Editor Universal format.
